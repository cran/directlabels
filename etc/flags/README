downloaded the svg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states

Then converted it manually to ps using inkscape... is there some
command line tool available? I couldn't find one so I wrote svg2ps.py.

download all states with download.R.

good example of what i'm trying to do

however the key difference is that I would like to be able to use size
and alpha as aesthetics as well.
