How to respect predefined scale_colour_manual() in ggplot2?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3337765/can-i-use-direct-label-with-ggplots-scale-colour-manual
I tried to do a hack that looks into p$scales$.scales to turn off the
legend (r371), but that didn't work so well, so I went back to the
method of just adding a new scale_colour_discrete(legend=FALSE) (r382)
For now, just set the scale_colour_manual AFTER the call to direct.label():
p <- ggplot(...)
p2 <- direct.label(p)
p2+scale_colour_manual(...)

Need to figure out how to calculate label bounding boxes for ggplot2.

closest.on.ahull calculation should take into account visual
coordinates, not plotting coordinates (could run into problems if
horiz and vert axes are on widely different scales).
