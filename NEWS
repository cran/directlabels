Changes in version 2024.1.21

- fix legends2hide issue with ggplot2 3.5.0.

Changes in version 2023.8.25

- CRAN NOTE doc fixes.
- use Suggests conditionally in examples/tests.

Changes in version 2021.2.24

- rgb to grayscale formula corrected in polygon.method().

Changes in version 2021.1.13

- Remove bitmapType cairo in examples vignette.

Changes in version 2020.12.29

- fix for single ggplot with two geom_dl with same method. previously this would create two grobs with the same name in a single gTree, which is not allowed (as documented in ?gTree) and resulted in only the first geom_dl being drawn. Now we append a unique integer id to each name so that grid draws both geom_dl.
- fix for lattice: Get lattice transformation functions working again + tests. (Error: data must have a column named label for qqmath examples)
- dldoc no longer uses type="cairo" at request of CRAN.

Changes in version 2020.6.30

- custom.colors argument for polygon.method, default choice of white or black depending on how dark the color would be if rendered as grayscale.

Changes in version 2020.6.17

- grid grobs have names.
- vignette example / LOPART100 data for black/blue pos swapped for t=100. (bug fix in make.tiebreaker, use rule=2 in approx for no NA)
- using top.qp with one point gave an error: need at least two non-NA values to interpolate. (bug fix in make.tiebreaker, only run approx if there are at least two values)
- legends2hide inside tryCatch to fix error with parsing legends in ggplots with custom themes, https://github.com/tdhock/directlabels/issues/6
- fix test failures that showed up with new code.
- examples vignette for geom_dl with same aes(label), but different aes(label.group, color).
- draw.polygons/polygon.method support top/bottom as well as first/last/left/right. New *.polygons methods.

Changes in version 2020.6.7

- initial code for:
- polygons below the point.
- aes(label) which may have the same value for two different aes(group) values, e.g. two algorithms/groups which both compute the same thing, optimal changepoint tau^*, but we want to compute and show a label for each of them.
- using stringDescent to compute height of boxes. maybe consider grobDescent or descentDetails?

Changes in version 2020.1.31

- remove Suggest ElemStatLearn.
- remove prostate dl.combine example.

Changes in version 2019.12.5

- update for new testing software.

Changes in version 2018.10.5

- Non-syntactic variable names supported, e.g. aes(color=`car class`)

Changes in version 2018.5.22

- Update Suggest dplyr to pass CRAN checks.

Changes in version 2017.03.31

- test case and bugfix for lasso.labels with a constant line.

Changes in version 2017.03.24

- test case and bugfix for using directlabels when ggplot2 is not attached to the global namespace. this happens if directlabels is used in a ggplot in a package that imports ggplot2 but does not attach it, e.g. https://github.com/tdhock/penaltyLearning/blob/master/R/IntervalRegression.R

Changes in version 2017.01.03

- Test and bugfix for angled.boxes -- there was some problem with the colour column (one of the columns to.restore after applying far.from.others.borders) being treated as a factor.

Changes in version 2016.10.25

- delete browser() in qp.labels

Changes in version 2015.12.16

- importFrom non-base packages.

Changes in version 2015.12.15

- ggplot2 does not need to be installed for package checks to pass.

Changes in version 2015.12.14

- suggest ggplot2 >= 2.0.

Changes in version 2015.11.28

- Works with new ggplot2 >= 1.0.1.9003 internals. (and no longer works with older ggplot2 internals!)

Changes in version 2015.6.17

- Namespaces fixes to ensure that R CMD check runs cleanly,  and that you can use `geom_dl()`  without attaching directlabels to the search path.

Changes in version 2014.6.13

- geom_dl(show_guide=FALSE) is default.

Changes in version 2014.5.12

- custom colors for dotplots in lattice, see etc/lattice-custom-colors.R

Changes in version 2014.4.25

- BUGFIX: bumpup works when there is only 1 group.

Changes in version 2014.1.31

- use fill if no colour in ggplots.
- guides(others_with_colour="none")

Changes in version 2014.1.27

- polygon.methods for lineplots.

Changes in version 2013.11.21

- projectionSeconds data set and angled.boxes Positioning Method, inspired by Mark Schmidt's prettyPlot. http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/prettyPlot.html
- draw.rects draws a rotated box when rot is specified.

Changes in version 2013.9.17

- label.endpoints can handle the case (common for scatterplots) where there are several endpoints with the same x value.

Changes in version 2013.8.2

- geom_dl aes inherits from the colored geom aes.

Changes in version 2013.7.24

- Doc updates: drawDetails.dlgrob documents interpretation of columns, apply.method uses itemize list, \code{\link{fun}} hyperlinks.

Changes in version 2013.6.15

- Documentation updates.

Changes in version 2013.6.14

- Depend on quadprog.
- Bugfix for reduce.cex.lr: decrease the text size based on previous cex, rather than assuming the previous cex is 1.
- Remove follow.points, perpendicular.(lines|grid).
- Change with/within/transform/subset to alternatives that do not generate NOTEs during package check.
